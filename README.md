### Hi there 👋

### About Me:

I am a full-stack web developer with extensive experience working in production, logistics, customer service, and management in a multi-cultural setting. Having already earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration while working full time, I recently graduated from UW Coding Bootcamp, an intensive six-month certificate program. I am now searching for a web development position with a company I am passionate about.
